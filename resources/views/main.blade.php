        <h1 class="display-3">volunteering and work experience</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="lead display-5">2020-21 I was a teaching assistant in mathematics at Harvard University. I helped TA several classes: Math 23a “Real Analysis and Linear Algebra I”, RA-23 “Real Analysis”, and currently Math 23c “Mathematics for Computation and Data Science”. This has involved running sections and office-hours, writing quizzes, and grading. It has also involved building software for presenting proofs and problems. Finally, I have interacted with students, identifying what would not be clear, and finding alternative ways to explain.
            <li><p class="lead display-5">2020 I worked part time remotely for the StopTB Partnership (a division of the United Nations Office for Project Services). I wrote scripts to collect any data I could find on TB key populations (such as prisons). I determined which data to collect, how to efficiently filter it, using algorithms and mathematics. I even started working on the presentation of the data to the public, applying my more creative side! I also had the chance to work with people like Dr. Sara Gonzales, Data-Analyst and member of the Secretariat (the Executive Director’s office).
            <li><p class="lead display-5">2020 Over quarantine, I helped build an internet-linked, battery-powered, high-capacity, automatic hand hydro-alcohol dispenser at Safe and Clean. These have been deployed worldwide, have created jobs in a depressed economy, and have earned millions in sales. I was able to help design the internet-communication-protocols for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) subsystem whose patent has been granted.</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead display-5">I was accepted to work at the Oxford Physics Rutherford Appleton Laboratory under Dr. Shinji Machida, but am waiting for COVID-19 restrictions to pass, before I can start interning there.</p></li>

        <ul>
            <li><p class="lead display-5">2020 One of my works was included in the 820 accepted and displayed out of over 7600 submitted for the Young Art Competition at the Royal College of Arts in London</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead display-5">2020 I was part of Westminster School’s group Chinese Speaking team for the national British Council Mandarin Speaking Competition, where were part of the 13 teams that reached the finals.</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead display-5">2020 I was the leader of the school Pi-wars robotics team.</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead display-5">2018-19 I was a member of Westminster School’s Cyber Centurion team, specializing in Linux Cyber Security. (We succeeded in passing 3 rounds).</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead display-5">Every year I ski in the Alps. I have passed the ESF’s gold star exam and have won ‘Le Grand Tetra’. I am now working towards competition.</p></li>
